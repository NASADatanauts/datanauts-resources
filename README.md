# Datanauts 2016 Challenge Resources


NASA wants YOU to engage with our open data to create innovative new thinking, processes, and products -- no matter your background or expertise. Our goal: attract data newcomers, introduce and advance data science skills, and create a vibrant data problem-solving community. Join us. It's time to explore your inner space data geekness.

As Datanauts, you'll have an opportunity to host space data events in your community, if you choose. We'll provide the data ingredients to create cool tech projects. You invite your friends, family, colleagues, and/or neighbors. We want you to love our out-of-this-world data as much as we do.

Each month, you'll receive a challenge tailored to your unique interests and skill level. Race against the clock to solve your challenge before the month ends!

Use the resources outlined below to supplement your Challenge solutions!
